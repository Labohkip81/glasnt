# What on earth is going on? 

My README.md is dynamically generated based on what my profile looks like. 

Every hour (see [.github/workflows/](.github/workflows), `build.py` is run to
dynamically generate my README.md based on current data from GitHub, and commit
that back to the repo. 

Idea and `build.yaml` from [simonw](https://github.com/simonw).
